### NOTE: All this process need to be done in windows operating system.

BIOS files can become corrupted due to various reasons, and when that happens, it can lead to significant issues with your computer's functionality. Here are some common causes of BIOS file corruption:

1. **Interrupted BIOS Update:** Updating the BIOS is a delicate process. If the update is interrupted or halted due to power failure, system crash, or any other reason, it can corrupt the BIOS files. This interruption leaves the BIOS in an incomplete or inconsistent state, leading to corruption.
    
2. **Malware or Virus Attacks:** Malicious software can target the BIOS, attempting to modify or infect its files. This can cause corruption, rendering the BIOS unable to perform its functions correctly.
    
3. **Hardware Issues:** Faulty hardware components such as a failing CMOS battery or a malfunctioning motherboard can lead to BIOS corruption. Fluctuations in power supply, overheating, or physical damage to the hardware can affect the BIOS files.
    
4. **Incompatible BIOS Updates:** Installing an incorrect or incompatible BIOS update for your specific hardware model can result in corruption. Always ensure that you're using the correct BIOS update intended for your motherboard or system.
    
5. **User Error:** Making incorrect changes or adjustments within the BIOS settings without proper knowledge or understanding can potentially corrupt BIOS files. Accidentally altering critical settings or parameters may lead to instability or corruption.
    
6. **BIOS Chip Issues:** Physical damage or wear and tear to the BIOS chip itself can cause corruption. This might occur due to aging, manufacturing defects, or exposure to environmental factors like excessive heat or moisture.
    
7. **Unreliable Third-Party Software:** Using unreliable or poorly developed third-party tools that claim to update or modify the BIOS can sometimes result in corrupting the BIOS files instead of updating them properly.
    

Preventing BIOS corruption involves being cautious during updates, avoiding interruptions, ensuring compatibility, and protecting your system from malware. Regularly backing up your BIOS settings and keeping an eye on hardware health can also help mitigate the risk of BIOS corruption. If your BIOS becomes corrupted, it may require expert intervention to restore or re-flash the BIOS using specialized tools and procedures provided by the manufacturer.

When the BIOS files become corrupted or damaged, it can result in various symptoms, including:

1. **Boot Failure or Errors:** Your computer might fail to boot or show error messages during the boot process. This could include messages like "BIOS ROM Checksum Error" or "BIOS Corrupted."
    
2. **Inability to Access BIOS Settings:** You might find that you're unable to access the BIOS settings even after repeatedly trying to enter by pressing the appropriate key during startup.
    
3. **Random System Behavior:** Corrupted BIOS files can cause erratic behavior in your system. This might include sudden shutdowns, freezes, or unexpected restarts.
    
4. **Missing or Incorrect Hardware Detection:** The BIOS might fail to detect or properly identify certain hardware components connected to your computer.
    
5. **System Instability:** Your system might become unstable, leading to crashes or unusual behavior while using applications or performing regular tasks.
    
6. **No Display (Black Screen):** In severe cases, a corrupted BIOS might result in a black screen upon startup, preventing any visual output or interaction with the system.
    

If you're experiencing any of these issues and suspect BIOS corruption, it's essential to address the problem promptly. Seeking professional assistance or referring to the manufacturer's support resources for BIOS recovery or re-flashing might be necessary to restore the BIOS to a functional state.

Most of the cases its shows like mention below

Following BIOS corruption, some computers or laptops are designed to initiate an automatic BIOS recovery process from backup files. This recovery process typically triggers automatically, but there might be a delay of a few minutes before it starts. During this time, the system might appear inactive or stuck, but it's actually in the process of initiating the BIOS recovery from the backup files. This delay allows the system to verify and prepare for the recovery, ensuring a more stable restoration of the BIOS. It's essential to allow the recovery process to complete without interruptions for a successful restoration of the BIOS.

In situations where the BIOS recovery files are either missing or corrupted, an alternative approach involves utilizing another computer or a USB flash drive to facilitate the update or insertion of the BIOS recovery files. In such cases, the process typically entails obtaining the correct BIOS recovery files from the manufacturer's official website, transferring them to a USB flash drive, and then using this external source to recover or update the corrupted BIOS on the affected computer. This method provides a workaround when the standard BIOS recovery process is hindered by missing or damaged files, allowing users to restore the BIOS functionality and resolve issues related to corruption. Always ensure that the replacement files are compatible with the specific model and version of the motherboard to avoid further complications during the recovery process.

Before downloading or flashing BIOS files, scanning the QR code presented on the screen can be a helpful step to ensure authenticity and prevent potential risks. QR codes can serve as a verification method provided by manufacturers to confirm the legitimacy of the BIOS files and avoid downloading corrupted or tampered versions. Scanning the QR code can direct you to the manufacturer's official website or a secure source

Certainly! In some instances of BIOS file corruption, attempting to access the QR CODE may result in a 404 WebError or a similar error message as shown

* **Saving the Downloaded BIOS Files:**
    
    * Once downloaded, save the BIOS recovery files to a location on your computer. This ensures easy access when performing the recovery process.
        
* **Prepare a USB Flash Drive:**
    
    * Insert a USB flash drive into your computer. Ensure it has enough storage space and is formatted correctly to be recognized by your system.
        
* **Open the Downloaded BIOS Recovery File:**
    
    * Locate the downloaded BIOS recovery file on your computer. Double-click or open the file to initiate the recovery process.
        
* **Select USB Flash Recovery Option:**
    
    * Within the BIOS recovery tool or software, there should be an option to choose the method of recovery. Select the "USB Flash Recovery" or a similar option from the available choices.
        
* **Follow On-Screen Instructions:**
    
    * The BIOS recovery tool will prompt you to select the USB flash drive as the destination for the recovery files. Follow any additional on-screen instructions provided by the recovery tool.
        
* **Flashing the BIOS:**
    
    Turn off the computer that requires the BIOS recovery, and then wait 5 to 10 seconds.
    
* Insert the USB flash drive with the BIOS file into an available USB port on the computer.
    
* Press and hold the Windows key and the b key at the same time, and then simultaneously press and hold the power button for 2 to 3 seconds.
    
* Continue to hold the Windows and b keys, but release the power button. You might hear a series of beeps.
    
    * **If a message displays that the computer improperly shut down or a boot problem is detected**, follow the on-screen instructions to resolve the error.
        

Hence the laptop restart for several times and it takes much time to flash the BIOS Recovery files .
